# Visualizing-COVID-19-Data

## Background

As the COVID-19 crisis continues to worsen all over the world, we need accurate information and efficient responses. Studying the data available is imperative to get there. However, we also want to know how to present our data in a way that is easy to navigate, comprehensive, and straightforward. In this study we explore ways to visualize COVID-19 data and therefore better understand the consequences of the pandemic on counties across the US. This study was conducted over Google Colab.
